These exercise entails compilation of week 3 to week 5 assignments.

This will enable us to be skilled in using git and github to create branches of our projects, which i believe is the aim of this assignments.

In the assignments giving to us by our Zuri mentor, Sir Isiaka, we are meant to create 3 branches of week 3 to week 5 and updload them to github which I did.
